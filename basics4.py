# +	Addition	x + y

# *	Multiplication	x * y	
# /	Division	x / y	
# %	Modulus	x % y	
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y

# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# logical
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

#identity
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

#bitwise
# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
# ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
# ~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2
